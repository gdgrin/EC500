I liked sql more than mongodb for one reason - it was more intuitive. The API was built the way I would have built it if I was designing it myself.
Also, it was really nice to be able to use sqlite db browser interface. This was easier than using the terminal session to view database entries.
Lastly, sqlite is already included in Mac OS X, needing no installion, unlike mongodb.
